# gene-exp-viz

A shiny app prototype for checking spatial expression patterns of individual genes from transcriptomics data.

To use:

- install git
- do `git clone https://github.com/etlioglu/shiny-apps.git` within the terminal
- download [the expression data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14XEKBCySwzhFiINdjhsi8rilDHr6NOj-/view?usp=sharing) and move into `shiny-apps/gene-exp-viz`
- spin up `Rstudio`, set `shiny-apps` as the working directory, open `gene-exp-viz/app.R` and hit `Run App`
- synonyms of genes used when possible, in such cases you would see a gene symbol other than you entered
